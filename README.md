# Project README

## Overview

This README document provides a comprehensive overview of the Software Requirements Engineering project, detailing the processes followed, the methodologies applied, and the outcomes achieved. The project aimed to establish a robust foundation for developing a software application by defining clear and precise software requirements. This was achieved through systematic requirement gathering, analysis, modeling, validation, and documentation.

## Project Objectives

- **Elicitation of Requirements**: To gather detailed and relevant requirements from stakeholders through interviews, focus groups, surveys, and prototyping.
- **Requirements Analysis**: To analyze and refine the requirements to ensure they align with business objectives and stakeholder needs.
- **Modeling of Requirements**: To create models that visually represent the data, processes, and interactions within the system.
- **Verification and Validation**: To ensure the requirements are complete, consistent, feasible, and testable.
- **Documentation**: To produce a clear and structured Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document along with other supportive documents such as the Vision and Scope document and prioritized requirements lists.

## Process Followed

### 1. Elicitation

The requirement elicitation process involved multiple techniques:
- **Interviews**: Conducted with key stakeholders to gather in-depth information.
- **Focus Groups**: Utilized to facilitate discussions and gain multiple perspectives.
- **Surveys**: Distributed broadly to obtain quantitative data from a larger audience.
- **Prototyping**: Developed to collect feedback on preliminary design and functional concepts.

### 2. Analysis

During the analysis phase, the following tasks were performed:
- **Stakeholder Needs Matching**: Ensured that the requirements gathered align with the stakeholders’ needs.
- **Feasibility Analysis**: Assessed the technical and economic feasibility of the requirements.
- **Prioritization**: Established priority levels for requirements based on their impact and necessity.

### 3. Modeling

This phase involved:
- **Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)**: Created to represent the flow of data within the system.
- **Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD)**: Used to model the data interactions and entities in the system.

### 4. Verification and Validation

Key activities included:
- **Review Sessions**: Conducted with stakeholders to validate the requirements.
- **Prototype Testing**: Used to verify the system’s functionality and design against the requirements.

### 5. Documentation

The final phase focused on the creation of detailed documents:
- **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**: Detailed all functional and non-functional requirements.
- **Vision and Scope Document**: Outlined the project’s purpose, key features, and limitations.
- **Prioritized Requirements List**: Provided a clear view of the requirements' priorities for guiding the development phases.

## Outcomes

The project successfully resulted in the following:
- **Comprehensive SRS Document**: Provides a detailed description of the software to guide developers and testers.
- **Validated Requirements**: Ensures that the system development aligns with user expectations and business needs.
- **Stakeholder Approval**: Achieved through continuous engagement and validation sessions.
